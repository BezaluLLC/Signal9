# Serverless SignalR Architecture Analysis

Here's how we could restructure:

## Current Architecture Issues

* Signal9.Hub runs as a Container App (always-on cost)
* Unnecessary complexity with hub hosting
* Over-engineered for the actual communication patterns needed

## Proposed Serverless Architecture

* Signal9.Web.Functions - Web portal backend, user management, dashboards
* Signal9.RMM.Functions - Agent communication, telemetry processing, command dispatch
* Azure SignalR Service - Direct connection management (no hub needed)

## Benefits

* True pay-per-use model
* Auto-scaling based on demand
* Reduced operational overhead
* Better separation of concerns between web and RMM functionality
